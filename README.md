# BinaryClassification_NumericalDataset
Binary classification on numerical dataset using different Sklearn models and Neural network

- An exploratory data analysis -> Feature Selection, Dealing with outliers, Handling imbalance of the dataset using SMOTE or resampling or random bagged classifier.
- Transform the data-> standardization vs normalization since it carries both numerical and categorical features.
- Nice Data Visualization using seaborn involving boxplots, stripplots etc.
- Train a model which predicts the class of the object (column “class”) [GALAXY, STAR]. Neaural Network vs Sklearn models.
- Test and evaluation of the performance of the model.
